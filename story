Two Cold-blooded Uncles Cooking to the Beat
A Short Story
As Told By Group 4 
Kathy Ramsbottom was thinking about David Ball again. David was a lovable monster with sticky thighs and fluffy fingernails.
Kathy walked over to the window and reflected on her chilly surroundings. She had always loved grey Moscow with its jolly, jealous jungle. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel cross.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the lovable figure of David Ball.
Kathy gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a courageous, special, tea drinker with beautiful thighs and hairy fingernails. Her friends saw her as a kindhearted, klutzy knight. Once, she had even brought an average old man back from the brink of death.
But not even a courageous person who had once brought an average old man back from the brink of death was prepared for what David had in-store today.
